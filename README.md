# FedCCFA: Classifier Clustering and Feature Alignment for Federated Learning under Distributed Concept Drift

This is the implementation of our paper: [Classifier Clustering and Feature Alignment for Federated Learning under Distributed Concept Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18478) (NeurIPS 2024). 
In this paper, we propose a federated learning framework with classifier clustering and feature alignment (**FedCCFA**).

## 📄 Experiments

### Hyperparameters

All hyperparameters can be set in ./configs/*.yaml. Common hyperparameters in our experiments are list as follows:

| Hyperparameter | Values                                   | Description                                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| client_num     | 20 or 100                                | 20 with full participation or 100 with 20% participation |
| sample_ratio   | 1 or 0.2                                 | full participation or 20% participation                  |
| dataset        | Fashion-MNIST or CIFAR10 or CINIC-10     | Three datasets in our experiments                        |
| alpha          | 0.1 or 0.5                               | concentration parameter in Dirichlet distribution        |
| drift_pattern  | false / sudden / incremental / recurrent | concept drift pattern                                    |

> The above numerical values (for client_num, sample_raio and alpha) are used in our experiments. You can select any
> value you want.

For the descriptions of other hyperparameters, please refer to our paper for more details.

### Example for FedCCFA under sudden drift setting

Edit configs/FedCCFA.yaml (e.g., set "drift_pattern" to "sudden").

```shell
cd methods
export PYTHONPATH=../
python3 FedCCFA.py
```

## 💡 Other Implementation

You can easily develop other FL algorithms by this repository.

First, create a new python script: entities/XXX.py

```python
from entities.base import Client, Server

Class XXXClient(Client):
    def __init__(self, client_id, args, train_set, test_set, global_test_id):
        super().__init__(client_id, args, train_set, test_set, global_test_id)
    
    def train(self):
        """New local training method if needed"""
        pass


Class XXXServer(Server):
    def __init__(self, args):
        super().__init__(args)
    
    def aggregate_by_params(self, clients):
        """New aggregation method if needed"""
        pass
```

Then, create a new python script: methods/XXX.py. Please refer to methods/FedAvg.py to implement new FL process.
